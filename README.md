# SNG - System & Network Grapher

Simple, portable, network and system stats plotting tool. 

Supports multiple graphs with:

- Ping / ICMP Echo
- SNMP and local interface bandwidth throughput
- Some local stats like CPU, Mem, Load Avg
- Shell commands

## Supported OS

- macOS/osx
- FreeBSD
- Linux
- Solaris
- HP-UX
- AIX
- UnixWare
- IRIX
- Tru64

## Supported Graphics/UI backends

- X11
- GTK
- SDL
- GLFW

## Elevated permissions

ICMP Echo/Ping requires elevated (root) privileges. To get ping working you will need to run SNG either with:

Sudo:

```
sudo /path/to/sng
```

Setuid:

```
sudo chmod +s /path/to/sng
```

Setcap:

```
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /path/to/sng
```

Sysctl ping group:

```
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 2147483647"
```

Sysctl ping group - permanently:

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "net.ipv4.ping_group_range = 0 2147483647" >> /etc/sysctl.conf'
```

Unprivileged ping via shell command (lame!):

```
[targets]
shell=ping -i 10 1.1.1.1 | sed -l 's/^.*time=//g; s/ ms//g'
```

## Config file

If `sng.ini` doesnt exist the app will create you a sample one on start.

The app looks at current working directory then various system config locations like `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, eg `$HOME/.config/sng/sng.ini` or `~/Library/Preferences` on macOS.

You can also specify the location with `-f /full/path/to/sng.ini`

## Config Directives

**[global]**
- `background_color`, `text_color`, `border_color`, `line_color`, `line_color_secondary`, `error_line_color` - hex RGB (e.g., `00ff00`)
- `default_height`, `default_width` - pixels
- `refresh_interval_sec` - seconds
- `window_margin` - pixels
- `max_fps` - frames per second
- `fullscreen` - `0`, `1`, `force`
- `fps_counter` - `0`, `1`
- `font_size` - float or font name
- `font_name` - font family name

**[targets]**
- `ping=<host>` - ICMP echo (e.g., `ping=1.1.1.1`)
- `bw=local,<interface>` - local interface throughput (e.g., `bw=local,eth0`)
- `bw=snmp1,<host>,<community>,<ifidx>` - SNMP bandwidth (e.g., `bw=snmp1,192.168.1.1,public,7`)
- `cpu=local` - CPU usage percentage
- `memory=local` - memory usage percentage
- `loadavg=local` - load average
- `shell=<command>` - shell command output (e.g., `shell=ping -i 10 1.1.1.1 | sed 's/.*time=//;s/ ms//'`)

**[plot name]**
- `line_color`, `line_color_secondary`, `background_color` - hex RGB
- `height` - pixels
- `refresh_interval_sec` - seconds

## Max value autoscale

At present the "max" value and the vertical scale is computed based on lifetime max value and never decreases. This is probably not the best choice, however I find it work quite well in practice. It provides indication of how high the metric has ever gotten in the past.

## Performance Considerations

This app is meant to be running in background or on a stand alone display. As such, its optimized to consume as little resources as possible rather than be a fast and responsive UI.

SNG supports many UI/Graphics backends. Not all of them behave so nicely. If you care about low CPU usage, wasted cycles, power usage - prefer GFX=X11, then GTK3. Avoid SDL. Its designed for high performance games running at 60 FPS and it's pretty hard to make it yeld CPU back it will use more CPU cycles on idle.

## Devices

I run SNG on Raspberry PI with [HyperPixel4](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hyperpixel-4?variant=12569485443155) display. This display is super crispy and sharp but doesn't use HDMI video. Instead has it's own driver, which is Raspbian only.

To auto start add this:

```
cat > .config/autostart/sng.desktop <<EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=sng
Comment=sng
Exec=lxterminal -e /path/to/sng.sh
NotShowIn=GNOME;KDE;XFCE
EOF
```

sng.sh

```
xset s noblank
xset s off
exec /path/to/sng -f /path/to/sng.ini
```

You will also need to make it suid, setcap, or sysctl ping group.

Also you should switch from Wayland to Xorg in `raspi-config`.
